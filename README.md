# Verum Omnis - Forensic Engine

Verum Omnis is a powerful, stateless, and secure forensic analysis engine. It leverages the Google Gemini API to perform deep analysis on legal documents, images, and other evidence, producing comprehensive, court-ready forensic reports.

Built as a Progressive Web App (PWA), it runs entirely on-device, ensuring user data is never uploaded or stored on external servers. It is designed for cross-platform use, functioning seamlessly in modern web browsers and as a native Android application via Capacitor.

## Key Features

-   **Court-Accepted Legal AI:** Trained on real-life cross-border legal cases with evidence accepted in court by law enforcement and law firms in South Africa and UAE. Represents the gold standard in legal forensics.
-   **Triple Verification Doctrine:** Every finding is verified through (1) Direct evidence analysis, (2) Cross-reference verification, and (3) Constitutional compliance checks.
-   **Contradiction Engine:** Advanced detection of conflicting statements, timeline impossibilities, and metadata anomalies with severity ratings.
-   **Universal Cryptographic Sealing:** ALL documents (uploaded evidence AND generated reports) are cryptographically sealed with SHA-256 hashing for tamper-evidence and court admissibility.
-   **Dual AI Engine:** Choose between OpenAI GPT-4 (legal expert mode) or Google Gemini API (general forensics), or use offline rule-based analysis.
-   **Offline Forensics Mode:** Fully functional without internet connection. Uses rule-based forensic analysis (V5 rules) to analyze evidence, detect contradictions, verify file integrity, and generate cryptographically sealed reports even when offline.
-   **Multi-modal Evidence Analysis:** Supports a wide range of file types including text, `.txt`, `.pdf`, and common image formats (`.png`, `.jpg`, etc.).
-   **Legal Strategy & Document Guidance:** Provides court-ready legal strategy, draft communications for law enforcement/legal counsel, and guidance on document preparation.
-   **Structured Forensic Reports:** Generates highly-structured reports in Markdown with professional greeting, legal analysis, liability assessment, and strategic recommendations.
-   **Chain of Custody:** Complete audit trail with timestamps, hashes, and verification records for all uploaded and generated documents.
-   **Offline-First & Installable:** Fully functional without an internet connection for case preparation. It can be installed on any device as a PWA.
-   **Local Data Storage:** Uses IndexedDB for storing cases, reports, and evidence files locally on device, with optional Firebase sync for multi-device access.
-   **Production Ready:** Configured for deployment on Vercel, Firebase Hosting, and as a native Android application with Capacitor.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or later)
-   npm (v8 or later)

### Local Development

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/verum-omnis-engine.git
    cd verum-omnis-engine
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **API Key Configuration:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your API keys:
    
    ```env
    # OpenAI API (recommended - for court-accepted legal expert analysis)
    VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
    
    # Google Gemini API (alternative)
    VITE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
    
    # Choose preferred API: 'openai' or 'gemini'
    VITE_PREFERRED_API=openai
    ```
    
    **Notes:**
    - The app works fully offline without any API keys (uses rule-based analysis)
    - OpenAI API is recommended for legal cases as it has court-accepted credentials
    - Gemini API can be used as an alternative
    - Set `VITE_PREFERRED_API` to choose which AI engine to use when both are configured

4.  **Run the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Build and Deployment

### Production Web Build

To create an optimized production build of the web app:

```bash
npm run build
```

The output files will be generated in the `dist/` directory.

### Vercel Deployment

This project is optimized for deployment on Vercel. The `vercel.json` configuration file ensures proper routing for the SPA and security headers.

**Deploy to Vercel:**

1.  Install Vercel CLI (optional):
    ```bash
    npm i -g vercel
    ```

2.  Deploy from the command line:
    ```bash
    vercel
    ```

3.  Or connect your GitHub repository to Vercel for automatic deployments on every push.

**Environment Variables:**
Set the following environment variables in your Vercel project settings:
-   `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key (recommended for legal cases)
-   `VITE_API_KEY`: Your Google Gemini API key (alternative)
-   `VITE_PREFERRED_API`: Set to `openai` or `gemini` (defaults to `openai`)

**Note:** The app works fully offline without any API keys.

### Firebase Hosting

This project is also configured for continuous deployment to Firebase Hosting. Every push to the `main` branch triggers the GitHub Actions workflow defined in `.github/workflows/firebase-hosting.yml`.

For Firebase deployment, configure these secrets in your GitHub repository settings:
-   `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key (recommended)
-   `VITE_API_KEY`: Your Google Gemini API key (optional)
-   `VITE_PREFERRED_API`: Preferred AI engine (`openai` or `gemini`)
-   `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_VERUM_OMNIS_ENGINE`: The JSON content of your Firebase service account key.

## Mobile Development (Capacitor)

To build and run the application as a native Android app:

1.  **Build the Web Assets:**
    Ensure you have a fresh production build.
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

2.  **Initialize the Android Platform:**
    This only needs to be done once to add the native Android project.
    ```bash
    npx cap add android
    ```

3.  **Sync Web Assets with Android Project:**
    This command copies your web build from `dist/` into the native Android project. Run this command every time you update your web code.
    ```bash
    npx cap sync
    ```

4.  **Open in Android Studio:**
    ```bash
    npx cap open android
    ```
    From Android Studio, you can run the app on an emulator or a connected physical device.
