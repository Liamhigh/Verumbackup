# Verum Omnis - Forensic Engine

Verum Omnis is a forensic analysis engine built as a Progressive Web App (PWA). It runs entirely on-device with local storage, ensuring user data is never uploaded or stored on external servers.

## Key Features

-   **Local Storage:** All data stored locally using IndexedDB
-   **Multi-modal Evidence Support:** Supports various file types including text, `.txt`, `.pdf`, and common image formats (`.png`, `.jpg`, etc.)
-   **PDF Generation:** Generate reports as PDF documents
-   **Offline-First & Installable:** Fully functional without an internet connection. Can be installed on any device as a PWA
-   **Cross-Platform:** Works in modern web browsers and as a native Android application via Capacitor

## Tech Stack

-   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite
-   **PDF Generation:** jsPDF
-   **Storage:** IndexedDB (local-only)
-   **Native Runtime:** Capacitor

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or later)
-   npm (v8 or later)

### Local Development

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Liamhigh/Verumbackup.git
    cd Verumbackup
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Build and Deployment

### Production Web Build

To create an optimized production build of the web app:

```bash
npm run build
```

The output files will be generated in the `dist/` directory.

## Mobile Development (Capacitor)

To build and run the application as a native Android app:

1.  **Build the Web Assets:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

2.  **Initialize the Android Platform:**
    (Only needed once)
    ```bash
    npx cap add android
    ```

3.  **Sync Web Assets with Android Project:**
    ```bash
    npx cap sync
    ```

4.  **Open in Android Studio:**
    ```bash
    npx cap open android
    ```
    From Android Studio, you can run the app on an emulator or a connected physical device.
