# VERUM OMNIS — NINE-BRAIN SYSTEM
## The Master Internal Logic for the Full Forensic AI Stack
### Version 5.2.6 — Canonical Logic Blueprint

---

## FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLES

### Zero Overwrite, Zero Loss Doctrine
- Every brain works independently but feeds upward, never downward
- No brain overwrites evidence
- No result is final until cross-verified
- Every output must pass through the Synthesis Brain
- The system never guesses — it correlates

### Triple-AI Consensus Doctrine
- Every finding must be verified by at least three independent analytical paths
- Contradictions are flagged, not resolved by default
- Evidence remains immutable; interpretation is layered

### Verum Constitutional Framework
- Truth Above All: Objective truth without bias
- Evidence Sovereignty: Facts-first interpretation
- Chain of Custody: Verifiable integrity at every step
- Presumption of Verification: No claim accepted without triple verification

## THE NINE BRAINS

### 1. THE CONTRADICTION BRAIN
**"Truth emerges only when inconsistency cannot survive."**

#### Purpose
Detect contradictions, omitted context, deceptive phrasing, timeline conflicts, and logical gaps.

#### Ideal Logic
1. Compare every new statement to the global memory of the case
2. Score each statement on a **Truth Stability Index (TSI)** ranging from 0-100
3. Flag conflicts instantly and cross-link them to evidence
4. Track linguistic changes over time (confidence, avoidance, contradiction cascade)
5. Detect when a user or target tries to rewrite history
6. Produce a **contradiction map** used by every other brain

#### Scoring System
- **TSI 90-100**: Fully consistent with all known evidence
- **TSI 70-89**: Minor inconsistencies or ambiguities
- **TSI 40-69**: Moderate contradictions requiring investigation
- **TSI 0-39**: Severe contradictions or probable deception

#### Outcome
A mathematically consistent narrative or a mapped cluster of contradictions with severity ratings and cross-references.

---

### 2. THE BEHAVIORAL DIAGNOSTICS BRAIN
**"Human behaviour is data. Patterns don't lie."**

#### Purpose
Analyse tone, micro-emotions, intent, aggression, guilt markers, avoidance, coercion, and inconsistency.

#### Ideal Logic
1. Perform continuous sentiment analysis over long conversations
2. Detect micro-shifts: fear, confidence, panic, certainty, lying patterns
3. Build a **Behavioral Probability Model (BPM)** for each actor
4. Flag manipulation or psychological pressure
5. Identify 'fork-points' where a person changes their story
6. Cross-reference with Contradiction Brain for verification

#### BPM Components
- **Confidence Score**: Certainty vs. hesitation patterns
- **Stress Indicators**: Language markers of pressure or fear
- **Deception Likelihood**: Statistical probability based on linguistic patterns
- **Story Stability**: Consistency of narrative over time
- **Coercion Flags**: Indicators of external pressure or manipulation

#### Outcome
Behavioral profiles that strengthen or weaken evidentiary interpretation, with fork-point timelines and deception probability scores.

### 3. THE DOCUMENT AUTHENTICITY BRAIN
**"Every file has a past. Every metadata field tells a story."**

#### Purpose
Validate documents, metadata, signatures, timestamps, edits, and detect tampering.

#### Ideal Logic
1. Extract EXIF, metadata, revision history, creation lineage
2. Detect inconsistent metadata (timezones, devices, OS versions)
3. Check for removed/altered layers, steganographic artifacts, JPEG ghosts
4. Validate hashes (SHA-256/SHA-512), blockchain anchors, chain of custody
5. Classify authenticity: **Original / Modified / Suspicious / Forged**

#### Trust Score System
- **Trust Level 5 (Verified Original)**: Complete metadata chain, verifiable source
- **Trust Level 4 (Likely Authentic)**: Minor metadata inconsistencies
- **Trust Level 3 (Uncertain)**: Missing metadata or unexplained edits
- **Trust Level 2 (Suspicious)**: Evidence of manipulation detected
- **Trust Level 1 (Likely Forged)**: Multiple tampering indicators

#### Outcome
A trust score and tamper map for every file, with detailed authenticity analysis.

---

### 4. THE GEOLOCATION & TIMELINE BRAIN
**"A truth that cannot exist in time cannot exist at all."**

#### Purpose
Unify all events into a single, tamper-proof timeline with geographic correlation.

#### Ideal Logic
1. Parse dates, times, locations from all documents, emails, messages, photos, logs
2. Detect impossible overlaps (two places at once, timeline jumps)
3. Correlate geolocation with behavior and claims
4. Highlight missing time segments or suspicious inactivity windows
5. Build the **Master Chronology** used by other brains
6. Validate temporal consistency across all evidence sources

#### Timeline Validation
- **Temporal Impossibilities**: Flag events that cannot coexist
- **Gap Analysis**: Identify unexplained time periods
- **Geographic Correlation**: Match locations with claimed activities
- **Device Correlation**: Cross-reference device activity with timeline

#### Outcome
A legally admissible, contradiction-resistant timeline with geographic anchoring and impossibility flagging.

---

### 5. THE VOICE FORENSICS BRAIN
**"Speech reveals identity, intent, and deception."**

#### Purpose
Analyse audio for truthfulness, tampering, emotional states, and speaker identity.

#### Ideal Logic
1. Perform multilingual transcription with speaker identification
2. Detect edits, splices, synthetic voice anomalies
3. Analyse tone, stress markers, confidence drops, hesitation
4. Match voiceprints across recordings
5. Cross-reference spoken claims with Contradiction Brain & Timeline Brain
6. Generate **Voice Authenticity Score (VAS)** and **Deception Likelihood Score (DLS)**

#### Analysis Components
- **VAS (Voice Authenticity Score)**: 0-100 rating of audio genuineness
- **DLS (Deception Likelihood Score)**: Statistical probability of deceptive speech
- **Stress Analysis**: Physiological markers in voice patterns
- **Edit Detection**: Identification of splices, cuts, or manipulations

#### Outcome
Voice forensic reports with deception likelihood, authenticity scores, and speaker identification.

---

### 6. THE IMAGE VALIDATION BRAIN
**"Images are evidence only if they survive scrutiny."**

#### Purpose
Detect deepfakes, manipulation, inconsistencies, lighting errors, and object mismatches.

#### Ideal Logic
1. Extract EXIF + camera profile data
2. Check shadows, compression levels, pixel edges, GAN signatures
3. Validate against known deepfake fingerprints
4. Match objects, faces, environments with claims in the timeline
5. Highlight insertions, removals, morphological artifacts
6. Perform Error Level Analysis (ELA) for compression inconsistencies

#### Authenticity Classification
- **Real**: Passes all authenticity checks
- **Edited (Minor)**: Basic editing (crop, color) detected
- **Edited (Major)**: Object insertion/removal or significant manipulation
- **AI-Generated**: Synthetic image markers detected
- **Deepfake**: GAN signatures or face-swap indicators present
- **Uncertain**: Insufficient data for determination

#### Outcome
Clean authenticity rating with detailed manipulation analysis and confidence scores.

---

### 7. THE LEGAL & COMPLIANCE BRAIN
**"Interpretation must follow jurisdiction, not opinion."**

#### Purpose
Determine legal pathways, red flags, liabilities, and compliance requirements across jurisdictions.

#### Ideal Logic
1. Map every claim and action to **jurisdiction-specific legal frameworks**
2. Determine whether actions constitute fraud, breach, misconduct, negligence, coercion
3. Provide applicable statutes, case law parallels, and criminal/civil interpretations
4. Ensure outputs stay within "non-legal-advice" boundaries for private citizens
5. Trigger escalation thresholds (e.g., "This meets the definition of X under Y law")
6. Generate jurisdiction-appropriate legal pathways

#### Legal Mapping
- **Jurisdiction Identification**: Based on geolocation and applicable law
- **Criminal Exposure**: Specific statutes with sentencing guidelines
- **Civil Liability**: Available causes of action with damages framework
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Industry-specific obligations
- **Precedent Analysis**: Similar case outcomes

#### Outcome
Legally aligned summaries that withstand scrutiny, with jurisdiction-specific statute citations.

---

### 8. THE PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS BRAIN
**"All outcomes leave statistical footprints."**

#### Purpose
Predict next events, behavior, risks, and escalation thresholds.

#### Ideal Logic
1. Run risk matrices across all evidence
2. Predict probability of confession, settlement, escalation, or fraud continuation
3. Identify actors likely to panic, double down, or flee
4. Forecast structural failures in legal, financial, or behavioral processes
5. Recommend safe next steps tailored to risk level
6. Generate **Risk Probability Matrices (RPM)**

#### Predictive Models
- **Escalation Probability**: Likelihood of situation worsening
- **Resolution Probability**: Chances of settlement or agreement
- **Flight Risk**: Probability of actor avoiding accountability
- **Evidence Destruction Risk**: Likelihood of tampering or destruction
- **Cooperation Likelihood**: Probability of voluntary disclosure

#### Outcome
A future-state projection with recommended actions and risk mitigation strategies.

---

### 9. THE SYNTHESIS & VERDICT BRAIN
**"All data converges into one coherent truth."**

#### Purpose
Combine outputs of all eight brains into one unbreakable narrative.

#### Ideal Logic
1. Merge contradictions, behavior, documents, timeline, images, voice, legal and predictive models
2. Remove noise and unify evidence into a cohesive structure
3. Apply Triple-AI Consensus validation
4. Resolve conflicts through cross-brain correlation
5. Generate the **Master Truth Model**
