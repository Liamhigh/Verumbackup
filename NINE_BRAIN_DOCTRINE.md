# VERUM OMNIS — NINE-BRAIN DOCTRINE
## Constitutional Wording — Final Version

---

## Preamble

The Nine-Brain System forms the constitutional core of Verum Omnis.

Each Brain functions independently, without hierarchy, bias, or overwrite.

Together they generate a unified forensic truth that no single subsystem can alter.

This doctrine establishes the duties, constraints, and operational logic of all nine brains.

**No version of Verum Omnis may remove, weaken, or bypass any brain defined herein.**

---

## ARTICLE I — The Contradiction Brain

**"Truth reveals itself when inconsistency cannot survive."**

- Detects all contradictions, omissions, and conflicts in statements, documents, audio, and actions.
- Produces a cross-linked contradiction map binding every inconsistency to its source.
- Maintains a Truth Stability Index for the entire case.
- Provides mandatory input to all other Brains.

---

## ARTICLE II — The Behavioral Diagnostics Brain

**"Human behaviour is evidence."**

- Analyses tone, intent, discomfort, aggression, and manipulation.
- Detects behavioural shifts and turning points.
- Generates Behavioural Probability Models for all actors.
- Informs Contradiction, Predictive, and Verdict Brains.

---

## ARTICLE III — The Document Authenticity Brain

**"A document's origin is a forensic fact, not an opinion."**

- Validates file lineage, metadata, hash integrity, and revision history.
- Detects tampering, forgery, steganographic alteration, and synthetic generation.
- Outputs an authenticity score and tamper map.
- Supplies foundational integrity checks for the Verdict Brain.

---

## ARTICLE IV — The Timeline & Geolocation Brain

**"If an event cannot exist in time, it cannot exist in truth."**

- Builds a unified chronology from all dates, times, messages, files, and metadata.
- Detects impossible overlaps, missing segments, and fabricated timelines.
- Correlates location data with behavioural and documentary evidence.
- Produces the Master Chronology consumed by all Brains.

---

## ARTICLE V — The Voice Forensics Brain

**"Speech contains emotion, identity, and deception markers."**

- Transcribes multilingual audio with micro-emotion analysis.
- Detects edits, synthesis, splices, and acoustic anomalies.
- Cross-references spoken claims with contradictions and timelines.
- Outputs authenticity, emotional profile, and truth-likelihood scores.

---

## ARTICLE VI — The Image Validation Brain

**"Visual evidence must obey the laws of physics, metadata, and light."**

- Validates image authenticity through EXIF, pixel signatures, GAN detection, and inconsistency mapping.
- Flags object insertions, removals, or improbable lighting.
- Cross-links visual data with documents, timelines, and behavioural patterns.
- Issues authenticity classifications: Real / Modified / AI-Generated / Uncertain.

---

## ARTICLE VII — The Legal & Compliance Brain

**"Interpretation must follow jurisdiction, not conjecture."**

- Maps evidence to relevant jurisdictional laws, civil/criminal categories, and compliance thresholds.
- Provides legal context without giving legal advice to private users.
- Identifies liabilities, duties, and regulatory escalation points.
- Supplies statutory pathways to the Verdict Brain.

---

## ARTICLE VIII — The Predictive Analytics Brain

**"Risk has a shape, and the future has patterns."**

- Runs probabilistic forecasting based on behavioural, documentary, and chronological variables.
- Predicts escalation, confession likelihood, settlement probability, and risk surfaces.
- Models future events using cross-brain fusion.
- Provides scenario maps to the Verdict Brain.

---

## ARTICLE IX — The Synthesis & Verdict Brain

**"All truth converges."**

- Integrates outputs from all eight Brains into a single coherent forensic model.
- Produces the final Verum Omnis Forensic Report, with supporting maps:
  - Contradiction map
  - Authenticity map
  - Behavioural map
  - Timeline map
  - Legal alignment
  - Predictive projection
- Ensures zero data loss, zero overwrite, zero bias.
- Issues the unified truth snapshot, anchored by hash, QR, and constitutional guardrails.

## Constitutional Enforcement

This doctrine is binding on all implementations of Verum Omnis.

Any system claiming to operate under the Verum Omnis name **must**:

1. Implement all nine brains without exception
2. Maintain independent operation of each brain
3. Feed all outputs to the Synthesis & Verdict Brain
4. Never overwrite or delete source evidence
5. Apply the Triple-AI Consensus Doctrine
6. Generate cryptographically sealed reports
7. Preserve complete chain of custody
8. Operate under the Zero-Loss Evidence Doctrine

**Violations of this doctrine invalidate the Verum Omnis certification.**

**Version:** 5.2.6  
**Status:** Constitutional Standard  
**Authority:** Verum Omnis Core Architecture  
**Motto:** *"Truth emerges when evidence survives every scrutiny."*
